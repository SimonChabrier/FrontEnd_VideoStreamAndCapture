The search was to use and understand the new functionality actually recommended by MDN which allows access to the camera on modern browsers.

Currently the script allows you :

- select your phone or deskstop cam in list of devices available.
- start or stop the stream from your camera.
- take a capture that is displayed on the page.
- delete the capture and do as much as you want.
- get the list of constraints supported by your browser when using your camera.
- Canvas objet for capture size is dynamically mapped to the current streeam image size.
